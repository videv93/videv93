- [ ] C# - ASP.NET MVC
- [ ] Java - Spring MVC, Grails
- [ ] Ruby - Ruby on Rails, Sinatra

New Trends
> JAMstack

"JavaScript, APIs & Markup" is a modern web developemnt architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuild Markup

- No restriction on framework or library
- Websites are served as static html files generated from source files, such as markdown using a static site generator like Gatsby
- High Performance, generated at deploy time
- Cheaper and easy to scale
- Easy to host (Netify)

> Serverless architecture

Server operations without actually needing your own server
- "Backend" or "Functions" as a service (FaaS)
- Reduce complexity and costs
- Less infrastructure to manage
- AWS Lambda & Netify

> API-First Design

With more and more IoT (Internet of Things) expect to see api-focused Design
- Traditional we start with the UI and then move to the backend with a strict connection to the web app 
- With API-first design, you start with the appropriate APIs and then build productions on top of it 

> Machine Learning / AI & The Web

Machine learning & AI are growing in all areas of technology and can be useful in web apps/services
- Alternative to conventional data mining
- Remove security threats
- Machine learning APIs
- Producing content
- Study user behavior
- Much more...

> Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is a major trend in technology. In 2020, expect to see more of this in web apps, especially with search
- HTML5 Web Speech API
- Google Speech-To-Text
- Dialog Flow

Low-level bytecode can run in the browser
- Generated by languages like C, C++ and Rust
- Much faster than JavaScript

Wrap Up
> What To Do With All Of This...

Don't get overwhelmed and take it one step at a time. Do some more research to figure out exactly what you want to do and learn one thing at a time.
The more you learn, the easier it is to leanr more and to fit all of these technologies together
